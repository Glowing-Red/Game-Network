               <p>I'm just a small, unprofessional, hobbyist, of a programmer.<br>I make both websites and programs, none of which are useful as of now,<br>but purely educational for myself and the art of creation.</p>

               <h1>The Project</h1>
               <p>This project was a task given to me to show that I have the basics down and have some kind of understanding in JavaScript, the purpose was to create a website consisting of a Home and About page. The home page would be a front for a game library where I would be able to upload games I've created in Js, and I was required to make atleast one game of my own choice, there were some suggestions, which I decide to take. Thus I settled with Tic Tac Toe and Flappy Bird, both of which are simple yet enjoyable games.<br>But that is not all, before I actually created the website itself I had to make some sketches and wireframes for the website and a written plan for the whole website and what direction I want to go with it, as well as an time estimation for time taken in each page and game.</p>
